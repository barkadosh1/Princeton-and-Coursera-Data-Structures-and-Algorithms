# Princeton-and-Coursera-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Below are some projects I worked on in the computer science courses I took as an undergraduate student at Princeton University and through a couple of Coursera courses I took this past summer (2019). 

### Graph Implementations

- Graph.java
- GraphAdjList.java
- GraphAdjMatrix.java

### Shortest Path Using Breadth First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A-star Search

- MapGraph.java
- MapEdge.java
- MapNode.java
